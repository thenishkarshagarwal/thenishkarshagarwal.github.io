I started my journey in my own dream where I first saw myself typing something rapidly in the computer screen with black text over it, and something happens (unrealistic). I was 13 back then. After I woke up, I started researching about it and whether it's something which interests me, until I know I've already been in love with it. I've been hacking since then.
