I'm just a normal kid who got big aims and high expectations with his life, and is trying hard to fulfill them.

alright, I'm **Nishkarsh Agarwal**, who's trying to learn something new each day, and to become a better myself.

I started my journey in my own dream where I first saw myself typing something rapidly in the computer screen with black text over it, and something happens (unrealistic). I was 13 back then. After I woke up, I started researching about it and whether it's something which suits me, until I know that I've already been in love with it. I've been hacking since then.
